"""Configuration for the OBD Scanner.

All interval values are in seconds.

Lower interval values update the dashboard faster, but they also ask the OBD
adapter and ECU for data more often. If your adapter becomes unstable, shows
missing values, or the dashboard feels noisy, increase the intervals a little.
