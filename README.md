## Important OBD-II Note

This app uses standard OBD-II data through `python-obd`. Standard OBD-II mainly covers engine and emissions related ECU data.

ABS, airbag, BCM, window, mirror, odometer, ADAS and other manufacturer-specific module access usually requires brand-specific diagnostics, UDS/CAN tooling, security access and vehicle-specific CAN IDs. Those features are not guaranteed through this project or the `python-obd` library.

Features such as Driver Alert, speed warning, lane assist or other assistance settings are usually not available through standard OBD-II. Some cars expose them through manufacturer-specific coding tools, but this project does not write coding changes to safety or assistance modules.

## Vehicle Lookup Limitations

VIN reading and VIN based vehicle information are experimental. The VIN feature can still contain bugs and may not work correctly on every vehicle, adapter or ECU response format. It is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. This may be improved in future updates, but it is also possible that this feature changes heavily or gets removed if it cannot be made reliable enough.

License plate lookup currently only supports Dutch license plates through RDW data. International license plate lookup may be added in a future update, but this is not guaranteed. This feature may also change or be removed later if it becomes unreliable or too limited.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer recommended
- USB OBD-II adapter, for example an ELM327-compatible adapter
- A vehicle with an OBD-II port
- Windows, macOS or Linux

## Tested Adapter

This project is used and tested with this USB OBD-II adapter:

- [OBD-II USB adapter on Amazon.nl](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07MQ8GHG3)

In testing, this adapter works well with the dashboard for standard OBD-II live data, fault codes and connection detection. Results can still depend on the vehicle, ECU support, Windows COM port assignment and adapter quality, so other cars may behave differently.

Python packages used by the project:

```txt
flask
obd
pyserial
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aapjekebaapje/Car-OBD-Diagnostics.git
cd Car-OBD-Diagnostics
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

If PowerShell blocks the virtual environment activation script with an execution policy error, run this command in the same PowerShell window and then try activating again:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This only changes the policy for the current PowerShell session.

Activate it on macOS or Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running The App

Start the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open the dashboard:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

The app runs on port `5000` by default.

## Using A Real OBD Adapter

1. Plug the USB OBD-II adapter into your computer.
2. Plug the adapter into the vehicle OBD-II port.
3. Turn the ignition on.
4. Open the dashboard.
5. Go to `Service`.
6. Select the detected COM port, or leave it on auto-detect.
7. Use `Test Connection` or `Retry Connection`.

On Windows, the adapter usually appears as something like `COM3`, `COM4` or `COM5`.

## Demo Mode

Demo mode lets you test the UI without a USB adapter or vehicle.

Go to `Service` and enable `Demo Mode`. You can choose presets such as:

- Idle
- Cruise
- Heavy Load
- Fault Present

Demo mode generates simulated live data, fault code states, readiness values and vehicle information.

## Polling Profiles

The Service page includes three polling profiles:

- Performance: faster updates for a more responsive dashboard
- Balanced: recommended default for normal use
- Safe: slower polling to reduce adapter and ECU load

The selected profile is shown in the top bar and can be changed even when no USB adapter or ECU is connected. The app saves the selected profile locally and syncs it with the backend when available.

## HTML Report Export

The dashboard can export a styled HTML scan report with vehicle details, live data, diagnostic trouble codes, readiness information and freeze-frame data where available.

Reports follow the selected interface language:

- Dutch UI exports Dutch report labels
- English UI exports English report labels

The export button works in two modes:

- Live stream: exports the latest available live dashboard data
- Paused stream: exports the frozen dashboard snapshot

Report exports can be created as a full report, fault-code-only report, live-data-only report or vehicle-info-only report.

OBD units are cleaned up in the report. For example, RPM values are shown as `RPM` instead of raw library text such as `revolutions_per_minute`.

## Garage Notes

Garage notes are stored locally in SQLite and are linked to a vehicle identity. A note requires both:

- VIN
- License plate

The app can auto-fill these fields when vehicle data is detected, but they can also be entered manually.

Saved garage notes use a clean card layout with compact metadata chips for date/time, VIN, license plate and mileage. The garage database has one live search bar that filters while typing across VIN, license plate, title, mileage, note text and date/time.

Filtered garage notes can be exported as a styled HTML report. Notes can also be deleted from the local database with a trash button and confirmation popup.

## Configuration

Refresh timings and history limits can be adjusted in `config.py`.

```python
APP_VERSION = "v0.3.1"
POLL_INTERVAL = 0.1
RPM_POLL_INTERVAL = 0.05
OBD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 1.0
OBD_CONNECT_ATTEMPTS = 3
OBD_CONNECT_RETRY_DELAY = 1.0
MAX_POLL_INTERVAL = 0.8
FAST_SENSOR_INTERVAL = 0.5
MEDIUM_SENSOR_INTERVAL = 2.0
SLOW_SENSOR_INTERVAL = 10.0
STALE_AFTER_SECONDS = 0.9
SCAN_HISTORY_LIMIT = 20
```

Lower values feel more live, but they also query the ECU more often. Keep non-critical values slower to avoid noisy adapters and unnecessary ECU load.

RPM and speed are refreshed separately from slower dashboard values. This makes the gauges feel more responsive, but true millisecond-perfect sync is still limited by the vehicle ECU, OBD adapter, serial connection, Python polling and browser rendering.

## Language Support

The interface supports:

- English
- Dutch

The app loads a language-specific JavaScript file:

- `static/en_app.js`
- `static/nl_app.js`

The selected language is stored in the `obd_lang` browser cookie.

## Local Data

The app stores local configuration and scan history in:

```txt
scanner_config.db
```

This file is created and updated locally when you use the app. It stores settings, scan history and garage notes. Deleted garage notes are removed from this local database. Browser-side UI state and VIN/license plate lookup history are stored in `localStorage`.

Use the Reset UI Cache button on the System page if the browser keeps old dashboard state after an update.

## Troubleshooting

If no adapter is detected:

- Check the USB cable
- Check Device Manager for the COM port on Windows
- Try another USB port
- Confirm the ignition is on
- Select the correct COM port in `Service`
- Try disabling other software that may be using the adapter

If PowerShell blocks `.venv\Scripts\activate`:

- Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Activate the virtual environment again
- This setting only applies to the current PowerShell window

If Windows shows `PermissionError(13)` or `Access denied` for a COM port:

- Another app or Python process is already using the adapter
- Close other OBD/serial tools
- Stop duplicate `python app.py` processes
- Unplug and reconnect the USB adapter
- Try a different COM port if Windows assigned a new one

If live data is empty or unstable:

- Confirm the vehicle supports standard OBD-II
- Try reconnecting
- Try the Safe polling profile
- Check whether the adapter is a reliable ELM327-compatible device
- Increase refresh intervals in `config.py` if the adapter returns noisy values

If the dashboard says live data could not be read while the connection still shows connected:

- Some individual PIDs may be unsupported by the car
- The app may still have valid RPM, speed or other cached live values
- Try reconnecting or switching to the Safe polling profile
- Increase polling intervals if the adapter is unstable

If fuel level jumps around:

- Some vehicles report fuel level from a tank float sensor, which can move while driving
- Fuel level is refreshed slower because it is not critical live diagnostic data
- Large jumps can also point to adapter noise, wiring issues or a worn fuel level sender

## Safety And Disclaimer

Be careful when clearing fault codes. Clearing DTCs can remove diagnostic evidence that may be useful for repair work. The app includes SAFE mode protection to prevent accidental clearing.

Do not use the dashboard while driving. Have another person operate the software or use it only while parked.
